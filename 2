The starting airport doesn't have any demand

When calculating the number of pilots required, there are two constraints
1. The total demand must at least be less than or equal to the  (current_num_pilots * (number of timesteps - 1))
2. The largest demand on a single airport must be (current_num_pilots * (number of timesteps / 2)) AND one less than the total number of timesteps (The demand generator should never allow this to happen)

Added new assumption - not all pilots have to start on 0. They start on airport with most demand (this can be changed to add back more constraints if needed)

Pilot calculator does NOT work for demand = [2,2,3,3] - gets 3, can be done in 2
